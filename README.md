Intel Edison examples
=====================

The Intel Edison board uses an Atom CPU running Linux Yocto as the operating system. It is designed for DIY Iot (internet of things) applications using the same GPIO setup of the Arduino boards e.g. Arduino UNO.

To get started with the Edison board installing the flashing software and the IDE of your choice you can also check this [gist](https://gist.github.com/tappoz/52901a130c4e892f8d47).

- example involving [a light sensor and a LED](./A_lightSensorWithLEDExample)
- example involving [a sound sensor, a button, an LCD display and a LED](./B_soundSensorEnabledByButton)

To run the code you could use the Arduino IDE making sure the right board and port are selected (from the __Tools__ dropdown menu), then clicking on the __upload__ button.
